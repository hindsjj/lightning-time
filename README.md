# lightning-time

Modified for 2018 UI Drone Summit Lightning Talks.  

A super simple web page based timer with a buzzer for [UI GIS Day 2017](https://insideidaho.org/gis-day.html) lightning talks.

Only works in modern browsers. 

I use it on Firefox, full screen mode, on a touch screen laptop, folded in stand mode, making a lovely timer for an event.

**Use:** 
Click "Ready" to start; at the end click "0:00" to reset. 
Defaut is five minutes with a caution color at two minutes and warning color at one minute. 
To customize the time, add "#" with time,warning (for example, one minute with warning at 30 sec: lightning-time/index.html#60,30).

Inspired by and based on <a href="https://github.com/apg/timer" target="_blank">timer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mithro/lightningtimer" target="_blank">lightningtimer</a> projects.
